                        I hope you are doing great. This year has been tough for everyone, but let’s talk about some
                        <span class="scribble">other
                            shit</span> more pleasant news. This year I have behaved very well, I’ve been wearing
                        <span class="scribble">clean
                            underwear</span> masks every day, I always keep a bottle of <span

                        handy
                        just in
                        case, and I don’t go out that frequently as <span class="scribble">bars</span> libraries are
                        closed
                        now.

                        Web Developer
                        Job. I
                        have started to believe that hiring managers don’t exist, as I keep sending them letters,
                        but
                        they
                        never
                        reply. The computer you gave me last year is amazing, I’ve <span class="scribble">played

                        watched tons of tutorials to improve

                        them
                        while
